# ADR 0004: URL Share Feature for ALPS Profiles

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Currently, sharing ALPS profiles requires sending files. A URL-based sharing mechanism would improve collaboration.

## Decision

Implement URL fragment-based sharing for the online editor:

```
https://editor.app-state-diagram.com#content=<base64-encoded-alps>
```

### Why URL Fragment (#)

- Not sent to server, avoids server-side URL length limits
- Chrome supports ~2MB URLs
- A 1000-line ALPS profile (~30KB) becomes ~40KB in Base64, well within limits

### Implementation Plan

1. Add "Share" button to online editor
2. Encode current ALPS content as Base64
3. Generate shareable URL with fragment
4. Copy to clipboard

### Future Enhancement

Add "Edit Online" link to standalone HTML documents generated by `asd` command:
- Extract embedded ALPS profile
- Open editor with content via URL fragment

## Consequences

- Easy sharing of ALPS profiles via URL
- No file upload/download needed for quick collaboration
- Large profiles (>1MB) may hit browser limits
